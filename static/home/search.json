Our prototypes help to get real-life touch and feel of your products Feel We visit locations where products are available to observe the products and take feedback. We engage with users to get a better understanding of their needs Field We get on the shop floor to understand for thorough examination of application study, get insights and endure the designs are manufacturable. Floor ENGINEERING SERVICE Approach to R&D Projects ","2D to 3D Conversion Conversion of 2D drawings from the print, dwg/dxf or image format to high quality feature based parametric 3D models is our expertise area. 3D to 2D Conversion There is an immense need in the industry for development of 2D drawings from the models generated by designers. Typically for reverse engineered and concept models, there is a need to create product and manufacturing drawings as per the sample drawings or drawing generation standards. Toolabs helps companies in this niche area by providing deep engineering and CAD tool expertise for delivery of product drawings. 3D Parametric Solid and Surface Modeling We have expertise and facility to generate 3D feature based parametric models (with part history) for casting, sheet metal components, plastic products, etc. We bring in value by generating models based on the product idea, arriving at various concept models and incorporating functional design and safety standards. Surface Modeling Innovation and creativity are the two vital needs of the industry and we help companies by improving the aesthetic appeal of their products. In Surface modeling our product design team involves in generating aesthetic features to improve the styling and appearance of the products. We provide the product concept for review and presentation and also create animation for realistic appeal. The presentation can be delivered in video files as well as PowerPoint presentations. Assembly Modeling Product designers produce General Assembly layout (Skeleton Layout) of the product to be manufactured. We have expertise to develop the assembly from the given layout, using top down configuration, interference detection check and ensuring physical interaction of components using physical dynamics. We create multiple configuration of the assembly, apply corresponding materials to the components, and generate assembly drawing with Bill of Materials and recommendations based on customer input. Reverse Engineering Reverse Engineering techniques are effectively used in scenarios where physical models may require digital interpretation for enhancing or modifying the product tosuit a different segment/application. We convert the given physical models or image files of the product to digital models with accuracy and integrity.
